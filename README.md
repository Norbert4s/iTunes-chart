# iTunes-chart
Top 100 iTunes albums based on API

Using:

• VueJS - from CDN because project is so small, but Vue is really helpful in this situation.

• SASS - mixins and other helpers are super useful.

• Bootstrap - would not use(I like my custom css), but due to requirements I incuded it but only used it in only one situation.

• Animate.css - my go to animation library.

• axios - promise based HTTP client to get API.
